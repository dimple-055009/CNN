Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a **Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to accurately classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in **image recognition tasks**, particularly in the context of **medical image analysis and healthcare automation**. The model enhances **diagnostic precision** and reduces manual workload by automating digit recognition. The goal is to build a robust and efficient classifier capable of **generalizing well to unseen data**.

## Data Description
### 1. Dataset
The project utilizes the **MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition dataset**.

### 2. Data Loading
The dataset is loaded and prepared using **pandas DataFrames**. While specific file paths are not provided in the visible code, the intention is clear. 

### 3. Features
- **Input Features**: Pixel values of the handwritten digits, represented as a flattened vector.
- **Labels**: Digits (0-9), representing the actual digit in the image.

### 4. Data Characteristics
- **Images** are **grayscale** with pixel values ranging from **0 to 255**.
- Each image is **28×28 pixels**, a standard MNIST characteristic.

### 5. Preprocessing
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are **scaled between 0 and 1** by dividing by 255, improving model convergence.
- **Reshaping**: The pixel values are reshaped into **(28, 28, 1)** format to match CNN input requirements.
- **Encoding**: Labels are converted into **one-hot encoded vectors** for multi-class classification.
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into **training and validation** sets to assess performance.
- **Data Augmentation**: Augmentation techniques are used to artificially expand the dataset and improve generalization.
